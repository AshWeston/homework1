Code Re-factor
  

The purpose of this task was to refactor the existing code on a site to make it more accessible, following semantic html structure, and consolidating the css file.  

  

I have provided commentary on changes I have made within the html and css files.  

 

You can click on this link to view the updates I have made.  https://ashweston.github.io/homework1/ 

  

Below is the "Mock Up" of the existing website.

Thank you!
